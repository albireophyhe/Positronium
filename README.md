# Positronium
A repository to store Positronium decay simulation
These code will be functional under ROOT enviroment

#Implemented  
  1.Compton Scattering  
  2.2-body decay distribution  
  3.3-body decay distribution (Basic under Energy reservation)  
  4.PMT installed  

#To do  
  1.Positronium formation  
  2.3-body decay distribution (Momentum reservation check)  
  3.realtime decay  
  4.Background from Sodium  

#Future plan
  5.Using Geant4 to simulation physics phenomenone instead of self-made funtions.  
  6.Changable PMT configuration.
