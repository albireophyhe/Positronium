# Positronium
A repository to store Positronium decay simulation
These code will be functional under ROOT enviroment

#Implemented
Compton Scattering
2-body decay distribution
3-body decay distribution (Basic under Energy reservation)
PMT installed

#To do
Positronium formation
3-body decay distribution (Momentum reservation check)
realtime decay
Background from Sodium

#Future plan
Using Geant4 to simulation physics phenomenone instead of self-made funtions.
Changable PMT configuration.
